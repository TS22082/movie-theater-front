## Description
Create a web app that connects to Google Maps and showtimes API with a search bar that looks specifically for movie theaters in the Bay Area. Use HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery and React.

## User Story

As a user, When I go to the fist page I want to be able to see a map with the nearest theaters around me based on the zip code that I enter. Also I should be able to switch to list view.
By clicking on one of the theaters location it would toggle the name of the theater, address and phone number.
By selecting the chosen theater it would take me to a page that displays the movies that are showing with showtimes, runtime, rating, genre, IMDB link and trailer.
When I click on trailer it would toggle a window that would play the video from youtube.
